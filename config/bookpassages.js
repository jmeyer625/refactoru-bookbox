		passage: 'Then silence fell upon the hall, for those that stood there were astounded and afraid, and they thought that Beren would be slain. But Thingol spoke slowly, saying: "Death you have earned with these words; and death you should find suddenly, had I not sworn an oath in haste; of which I repent, baseborn mortal, who in the realm of Morgoth has learnt to creep in secret as his spies and thralls."'

		passage: 'The crowd grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theatre curtain go up at last, breathed from innumerable throats. They were going to have their bit of fun after all. The rifle was a beautiful German thing with cross-hair sights. I did not then know that in shooting an elephant one should shoot to cut an imaginary bar running from ear-hole to ear-hole. I ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight at his ear-hole; actually I aimed several inches in front of this, thinking the brain would be further forward.'

		passage: 'The market battle between credit cards and Christmas clubs is a good illustration of a more general point, one to which we will return. Markets provide strong incentives for firms to cater to the demands of consumers, and firms will compete to meet those demands, whether or not those demands represent the wisest choices. One firm might devise a clever self-control device such as a Christmas club, but that firm cannot prevent another firm from offering to lend people money in anticipation of the receipts of those funds. Credit cards and Christmas clubs compete, and indeed both are offered by the same institutions--banks. While competition does drive down prices, it does not always lead to an outcome that is best for consumers.'

		passage: 'To learn more about what these differences in experience can be, return for a moment to Aristotle, Galileo, and the pendulum. What data did the interaction of their different paradigms and their common environment make accessible to each of them? Seeing constrained fall, the Aristotelian would measure (or at least discuss--the Aristotelian seldom measured) the weight of the stone, the vertical height to which it had been raised, and the time required for it to achieve rest. Together with the resistance of the medium, these were the conceptual categories deployed by Aristotelian science when dealing with a falling body.'

		title: 'The 4-Hour Workweek',
		personas: ['Self-improvement', 'Male casual reader'],
		passage: 'Micro-testing involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing. In the pre-Internet era, this was done using small classified ads in newspapers or magazines that led prospects to call a prerecorded sales message. Prospects would leave their contact information, and based on the number of callers or response to a follow-up sales letter, the product would be abandoned or manufactured.'

		title: 'What Ever Angel Investor Wants You to Know',
		personas: ['Self-improvement', 'Male casual reader'],
		passage: 'Angels want to see a tight progression. Whether you start with a story that sets up the opportunity for the business or the need for the product, or whether you get right into the opportunity or need, start by telling us what you propose to do, why you propose to do it, and how you propose to do it. The presentation has to flow from a natural beginning to a natural conclusion.'

		title: 'A Meeting by the River',
		personas: ['Contemporary and classic highbrow fiction', 'Female casual reader'],
		passage: 'I\'d forgotten how powerfully charming he is. Even when you know all his tricks, he can still charm you. And anyone would have to admit that he looks marvellously young for his age. That black floppy hair with hardly any grey in it, those bright clear eyes with only the tiniest wrinkles showing white against his tan, those firm brown cheeks only slightly too heavy, and those beautiful teeth--they must certainly have had something done to them since I saw them last, they\'re unnaturally regular. Perhaps one of the dentists in Los Angeles put crowns on them. That\'s what they do to movie stars, and Patrick is a kind of star, he\'s fighting middle-age just as they do.'

		title: 'Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project',
		personas: ['Female casual reader', 'Male casual reader'],
		passage: 'With Adam\'s help Irena made final arrangements for five children to escape together through the sewers to the care of Sister Wanda Garczynska, Mother Superior at the Order of the Immaculate Conception. In preparation, Irena had visited the convent and spoken with one of the Sisters, Maria Ena, about receiving the children. They would pop out from a nearby manhole at five the next morning. The courier would take them to the convent, knock with a prearranged signal, and Sister would be waiting to let them in.'
